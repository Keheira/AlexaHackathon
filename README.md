# AlexaHackathon

Most people that use slack have seen the exercise scripts for your team members, but what if you wanted to take a quick exercise break yourself? Well we now have a skill for that. Start up our app and get a custom workout plan to fit the number of minutes you have to spare.

Future Plans: Take away the custom list so that exercises are called out randomly after a 1-2 mins. Also have Alexa count down the reps for users.
